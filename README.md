# theodinproject-landing-page

This is my second project within The Odin Project's curriculum. My goal here will be to use HTML and CSS to create a landing page of a website. My main focus here will be using flexbox to get the page laid out correctly as well as gaining more experience with the HTML and CSS structure.
